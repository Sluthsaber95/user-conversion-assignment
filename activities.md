## Lightweight Script
All injected scripts are to made as light weight as possible. So that it hardly impacts the performance of the client website;
a lot of the clients website's CSS were utilised as much as possible; things normally included such as the following below, were NOT included.

- Handling of Typography - adopted Calibri from UC website
- Normalise CSS + additional normalisation CSS scripts
- Using ES6 scripts (except template literals) - classes & arrow functions requires more lines of core JS runtime code.

The aim was to keep it running as fast as possible - using ES5 JavaScript.


## Responsiveness
The A/B component was tested on viewports ranging 480px to 1920px.

Please Note: CSS Flexbox was used, thus website compatibility only starts at IE11 (with vendor prefix support) and beyond.


## Instructions of Use
Simply copy and paste the scripts **design-1.js** or **design-2.js** into Chrome Devtools console. The resulting outcome would be the the appearance of the component specified.
