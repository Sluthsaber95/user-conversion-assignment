# User Conversion Task

## Preparation:

If you’re not already familiar with the concept of A/B testing or just need a quick refresher, we’d highly recommend checking out this link to gain a better understanding: https://www.optimizely.com/optimization-glossary/ab-testing/

Generally any changes we make to a website or new functionality we create is all done through client-side scripting. The reason for this is down to the way optimisation platforms such as Optimizely work. They inject scripts into websites during load (similar to a tag manager) as opposed to modifying the source directly.

In this task you should write your JavaScript in the browser console. Don’t worry though, this isn’t how we normally develop A/B tests at User Conversion, it’s just for the sake of simplicity. Internally we have our own workflow which allows us to still use our favourite code editors, tools and technologies.

For your CSS you should create a style element and insert it into the document. 

Once you’ve completed this task please save your code in a text document and send it over to the recruiter. Good luck.



















Brief:

Website: User Conversion

Pages: Homepage -  https://www.userconversion.com/

Task: 
For the first part of the task create a new section under the hero content which showcases the 3 most recent blog posts from the /ideas page (https://www.userconversion.com/ideas). You should build this in a way so the content is dynamic and updates whenever a new blog post is published. 

Refer to the design below for how this new section should look. To save you some time here is the CSS for the individual blog post boxes:

article.post{padding:35px;width:31%;margin:0 1%;box-sizing:border-box;background:#fff;display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;text-align:left}article.post .author-date{font-size:1.6rem;text-transform:uppercase}article.post header{margin-top:80px;display:block}article.post header h2{padding-bottom:20px;border-bottom:1px solid #d6dee2;padding-top:.5rem;margin:0;font-size:2.5rem;text-transform:uppercase;font-weight:800}article.post .post-categories{list-style:none;padding-left:0;padding-top:15px;margin-bottom:0}article.post .post-categories li{display:inline-block;font-weight:800;font-size:1.7rem;text-transform:uppercase;color:#d0d3d5}article.post .post-categories li a{color:#d0d3d5}ul.post-categories li:after{content:"\00b7";margin:0 6px 0 8px}ul.post-categories li:last-of-type:after{display:none}

For the second part of the task you should create a personalised banner that only shows if the user has navigated to the ‘Audit’ or ‘Training’ pages at any point (links are in the main navigation). The content for this banner should change depending on which page they last visited.

If audit was last visited:
Heading: Interested in our free audit?
Content: We review your data configuration, look for opportunities or red flags within your GA account, and using our experience, talent, skill set, alongside examples of other A/B tests we've run make immediate recommendations that are backed by data and are actionable - all packed within a 30 minute video.

If training was last visited:
Heading: We offer expert training for businesses
Content: Accelerate your knowledge, processes and skill set with us and the Chartered Institute of Marketing. We can provide CRO training for your team in optimisation strategy, web analytics, development and UX research.
